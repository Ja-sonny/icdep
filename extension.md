## Add location tages in front 

We could use location tags in front of the recipient like in lecture on Monday.
We would have tags such as ece 025 to figure out which way the cards have to move to reach the final recipient. This would be used such as

    if current location == ece
        if current room == 025
            give card
        if not get card out of room
        pass card around
    if not get out
    pass card around

## Content

The type of content could be written in the corner of the card.

## Keeping records

To dedicate the make of the card to write down all the nodes that the card has passed by. This way, we would be able to know which nodes the card has gone through. Another method is to make all the nodes remember what cards has gone by them. Both are very costly
