# Chain of cards
We could use a ring to connect cards with commands as well as the original card to use commands on individual nodes in the network. On the cards with commands on them would also have a recipient, and when the command card is passed to the desired recipient, the node will take the card off from the ring and perform the command. 

    I don't know if this is allowed. Missed last week's class and don't
    really know what the rules are for this ):
